### Data sources
This project was found on Kaggle. It entails the data of sales of an electronic commerce business. It has sales of countries, the invoice of sales made, the orders, it shows hours with most sales. It has over eighty thousand unique records.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

**Data Filtering**-The dataset was filtered by selectively extracting specific information dataset. It involved applying rules or conditions to the data to isolate relevant subsets and enhance its usability for analysis or presentation. The filtering process can be performed using various methods, such as using software tools

**Data Deduplication** involves removing duplicate records or entries from a dataset to maintain data accuracy and consistency. The duplicate values were identified and removed duplicate files within the storage system. The process involved scanning data for duplicate segments, replaced with pointers to the unique data copy.

**Data cleaning**- It involved Handling Missing data and identifying and dealing with missing values through imputation or removal. Removing Duplicate Entries and eliminating identical or redundant records to avoid distortions in analysis. Standardizing Formats Ensuring consistency in data formats for uniformity. Correcting Inaccuracies Identifying and rectifying inaccuracies, outliers, or anomalies that could skew results. Handling Typos and misspellings, Correcting errors in data entry, such as typos and misspellings, to maintain accuracy. Dealing with Inconsistent Data Resolving inconsistencies in categorical data or addressing conflicting information Data Outliers Identifying and managing outliers that may impact statistical analyses.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
I have been able to Maximize insight into this data set, uncover underlying structure, extract important variables, detect outliers and anomalies, Test underlying assumptions, and Determine optimal factor settings.
The main purpose was to open-mindedly explore the data, often without having a specific hypothesis in mind, to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. 

Rush hour occurs around 11-15 when the site sells more goods than other hours. The slowest periods are towards the end of the day and the beginning of the day. The 12th hour has the most traffic and sales.

A lot of customers and sales around the end of the year with November and December having massive sales and traffic 
But throughout the end of 2010, it picked up and the activity has remained high throughout 2011 with an estimation of 200 a day.

![Orders by Hour](https://github.com/datawithlusaka/E-commerce-Project/blob/main/Images/Orders_by_hour.jpg)

This chart shows the number of orders made by single customers’ the most being 1,584 orders. This is enough proof that the site and business are working efficiently and helping many people access the goods they require.
![Top 10 Customers](https://github.com/datawithlusaka/E-commerce-Project/blob/main/Images/top10_customers.jpg)

This shows the top 10 spenders in the business. This however comes as a shock as not a lot of the top orders are the most spenders which shows that the site is convenient for buying a lot of goods at a cheaper price as witnessed by the most orders placed.

![Top 10 Spenders](https://github.com/datawithlusaka/E-commerce-Project/blob/main/Images/amount_spend_by_top10.jpg)

This chart shows the top 20 most bought items and they need to restock the inventory. However, the gap isn’t tremendous hence showing that the chart might just shift. This also shows that the business is providing the required goods and hence the balance in sales.

![Top 20 Most Bought](https://github.com/datawithlusaka/E-commerce-Project/blob/main/Images/top20_items.jpg)

This clearly shows that the most expensive item bought was from the United Kingdom. The store majorly serves this region as it is evident with most orders coming from this region. It also caters to European countries majorly.

The orders throughout 2011 have been consistent with not much spike but the sales have increased nevertheless. This may be due to the infancy of the business as the orders picked up after a couple of months.
These 3 countries are above the average sales meaning they have done exceptionally well in the region in sales. over 19k orders are above average which means 19k only are spending above average. It means customers need to be encouraged to spend more.

The average quantity sold throughout was around 12 units. It also sold a total of 968,813 units in its operation. With 80,959 orders. It has only made losses of 3114 orders still putting in net profit.
